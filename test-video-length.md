### 3. Enhanced UI

- Added video length selection dropdown in GeneratorForm

### 4. Updated AI Generation

### 5. Updated Data Persistence

- Added videoLength to HistoryItem interface

## Video Length Options

- Short (30 seconds)
- Medium (1-2 minutes) - Default
- Long (3-5 minutes)
- Extended (5-10 minutes)
- Detailed (10+ minutes)

## How It Works

1. User selects "Script" as content type
2. Video length dropdown becomes visible
3. User selects desired video length
4. When generating, the AI receives length guidance in the prompt
5. The AI creates a script with appropriate amount of content for that duration
6. Video length preference is saved in history and templates

## Testing Steps

1. Open the application
2. Select "Script" as content type
3. Verify that video length dropdown appears
4. Select different length options
5. Generate a script and verify the output matches the selected length
6. Save as template and verify video length is preserved
7. Check history and verify video length is stored

The feature is now fully integrated and ready for use!
