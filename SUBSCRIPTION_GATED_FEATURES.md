const canUseCustomPersonas = canUseFeature("customPersonas");
const canUseAnalytics = canUseFeature("analytics");
```

### **Plan-Specific Messaging**

- Contextual upgrade buttons based on user's current tier

### **Visual Indicators**

- ✅ Green checkmark for available features
- 🔒 Lock icon for unavailable features
- Plan badges showing "Creator Pro" or "Agency Pro" requirements

## 🔄 Developer Testing

### **Plan Toggle (Developer Mode)**

The orange developer toggle in the header allows testing different subscription levels:

- Click to cycle: Free → Pro → Enterprise → Free
- Features update in real-time based on selected plan
- Visual feedback shows current plan and feature access

### **Testing Scenarios**

1. **Free User**: No premium features visible
2. **Pro User**: Templates, Analytics, Personas available; Batch Generation shows upgrade hint
3. **Agency User**: All features unlocked

## 🎨 User Experience

### **Graceful Degradation**

- Features show but are disabled with clear upgrade path
- No hidden features - users see what they're missing
- Contextual messaging based on current plan

### **Upgrade Hints**

```jsx
<SubscriptionUpgradeHint
  feature="Batch Generation"
  requiredPlan="business"
  featureDescription="Generate up to 50 content types simultaneously"
  onUpgrade={handleUpgrade}
/>
```

### **Smart Button Text**

- Free users: "Get Creator Pro" / "Get Agency Pro"
- Pro users (for Agency features): "Upgrade to Agency Pro"
- Clear plan progression

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### **Subscription Context Integration**

```typescript
const { billingInfo, canUseFeature } = useSubscription();
const subscriptionPlan = billingInfo?.subscription?.planId || "free";
const canUseBatchGeneration = canUseFeature("batchGeneration");
```

### **Feature-Specific Checks**

Each premium component checks:

1. User's current subscription status
2. Specific feature availability
3. Plan requirements for locked features
4. Usage limits and generation quotas

### **Components Updated**

- ✅ `SubscriptionUpgradeHint.tsx` - Upgrade guidance
