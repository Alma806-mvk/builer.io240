üé≠ **AI PERSONA**: Maintain ${aiPersona} tone and communication style throughout all strategy recommendations and explanations.

üéØ PREMIUM CONTENT STRATEGY

**PERSONA FIRST DIRECTIVE - TWO-STEP PROCESS:**

**STEP 1: PERSONA DEFINITION (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)**
First, and most importantly, write a detailed, two-paragraph description of the user's provided Target Audience: "${effectiveTargetAudience || "general audience"}". Do not generate any other part of the strategy yet. Just describe this specific audience in detail - their demographics, psychographics, behaviors, pain points, and content preferences. Be extremely specific to "${effectiveTargetAudience || "general audience"}" - avoid generic descriptions.

**STEP 2: PERSONA-DRIVEN STRATEGY GENERATION**
Now, using the persona you just defined in Step 1 as your absolute source of truth, generate a complete content strategy for "${userInput}" content that would appeal *only* to that specific "${effectiveTargetAudience || "general audience"}" persona you described. Every recommendation must be tailored exclusively to that audience.

**CRITICAL: The strategy must be so specifically tailored to "${effectiveTargetAudience || "general audience"}" that it would NOT work for any other audience type.**

**IMPORTANT: Return ONLY valid JSON in the exact format specified below:**

    "goals": [
    "Generate goals that are realistic and achievable for ${budget} budget level over ${timeframe} timeframe. Scale ambitions appropriately - low budget goals should focus on organic growth and efficiency, while enterprise goals can include aggressive paid acquisition and team expansion. Adjust timelines to match ${timeframe} - 1 month goals should be tactical wins, while 1 year goals can include major brand transformations."
